# uwl-python-ig/meetings
Meeting notes from University of Washington Libraries Python Interest Group \(UWL-PIG\) meetings

## Community Agreement
The UW Libraries Python Interest Group (UWL-PIG) is a community of practice that provides opportunities to learn about the Python programming language by inviting individuals and groups to present on their work, sharing Python-programming learning resources, and providing space for discussing Python programming, with a focus on using Python in library workflows and teaching and learning Python.

To support our learning community, we have adopted a community agreement originally developed by the UW Libraries' Digital Scholarship Collective:

### As a group, we:
- Are sensitive to the needs of others
- Give mutual respect, particularly when folks are making themselves and their work vulnerable
- Actively listen and engage with fellow group participants
- Recognize the intelligence and expertise in the group
- Acknowledge when we don't know something
- Value people over tools
- Seek lightness, collegiality, and humor
- Are flexible, as we acknowledge that our values and needs may change over time
- Remember that perfection is not the goal; embrace mistakes as part of the process
- Look for ways in which our community of practice can align with anti-racism and social justice
