## TOPICS
### BMR is working on processing CSV data using Python
- See:
    - briesenberg07 > [__csv_Python3_2021-12.md](https://gist.github.com/briesenberg07/1d3bdc9d079a8581768088dea1111f6b) (a gist, it explains the use case, I'll put the code here as well)

### Intros
- New to Python, have been working with NodeJS
    - I picked this because it's useful for drawing from multiple APIs and combining results
    - Within NodeJS there is Express, which simplifies CRUD processes 
    - At some point, is someone going to ask me to do something for which Node is not suited? Python seems more universal
- Carla
    - Previous CS degrees & SW engineering, but 10+ year gap. 
    - Now PhD student in Oceanography using Python (first time) in data analysis
    - Interested in learning more about the packages. I'm really rusty and just looking at the APIs to figure things out.
- Justin, Head, Digital Scholarship, UW Tacoma Library
    - Overseeing a repository (Digital Commons)
    - Have the experience of a grad student who really streamlined work processes by using Python (script still exists but doesn't work at this point)
    - Interested in getting started
- Abbie
    - Psychiatry Dept Asst. Prof. with lots of self learning and slow code when the data set gets too big. I love pandas!
    - Mostly use Python for scientific computing - signal processing, machine learning, inferential stats, data viz
    - VA health records project with billions of data points
- Background on group from Ben
    - Started by Hana L. in 2019
    - Started learning from a text and reviving it during the pandemic
    - Open group to investigate
    - Had some presentations on using work
    - Folks found about it through eScience newsletter
- Leah from Health Sciences
    - New to Libraries
    - We are thinking about services to provide at a new facility
- Paul
    - Only previous Python experience is from several months of a Udemy course three plus years ago
    - Looking to understand syntax for security and risk assessments, possibly some PenTesting too
    - It would be super useful for me to know how to use Python to check for vulnerabiities and general lack of security controls
    - Also want to learn more about using github, the best script editors to use etc....

### Learning resources?
- Software carpentry training coming up at UW
    - There are many "flavors" of carpentry training
    - Lots of documentation is written as if you have a CS background, carpentries avoids this
- API pages and other online documentation
- Yes, seems like lots of documentation (and courses) is aimed at production environments
    - For a personalized project you can make different choices
- UW has a subscription to [LinkedIn Learning](https://careers.uw.edu/linkedin-learning/)
    - There are so many! Which one to take??
    - So many options, including Coursera etc.
- One positive review for a Udemy course!
    - Had a good instructor and the course was well-structured
- I,m interested in GitHub training +1 (+1, with a focus on collaborative work like merges)
    - More GH discussion:
        - There are many levels with GitHub!
- Having a project is the best way to learn! Abstract learning doesn't seem to stick
- BMR loves [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)! 
    - So many great resources
    - Seems accessible for those without a CS background

### Ideas for going forward
- Crowdsource session ideas and plan for these--the GitHub session would be one for this
    - BMR can follow up through the listserv
- Drop-in sessions might be great
    - If it's possible to bring in folks with more experience this might be helpful
- Perhaps helpful to invite some carpetries people
    - Carpentries training coming up at the UW
- BMR loves case studies!
    - I'll present on my CSV project
    - Abigail: How about one on "Making Your Code Run Faster"
    - More on making code run faster: Could we invite a CS person to present
- There's a CS program at UWT... Lots of UWT CS students applied for a recent position, which was great, but the skills were completely new to me! How to direct a person with a very different technical skill set? How to do effective outreach to CS programs for Library projects and jobs? Etc.
