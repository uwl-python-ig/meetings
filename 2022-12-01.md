# MEETING NOTES
- I got started on PyMARC usage for an upcoming project, and started putting together some notes in my [notebooks_001](https://github.com/briesenberg07/notebooks_001) repository > [pymarc](https://github.com/briesenberg07/notebooks_001/tree/main/pymarc)
- Started working through a helpful [GitLab tutorial on PyMARC](https://gitlab.com/pymarc/pymarc)
