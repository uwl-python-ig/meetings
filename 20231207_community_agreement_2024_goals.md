# 2023-12-07 University of Washington Libraries Python Interest Group meeting

## Review Python IG community agreement
### Background + questions
- ***Our community agreement is adapted from the [UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Collective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8Ln1kCLVk_GPF-zC516nNjZIIByc-EvvFd69lFM0GU/edit?usp=sharing) community agreement***, but the DS collective's agreement has been updated relatively recently, and our adaptation hasn't been reviewed for some time (a couple  of years?)
- ‚ùì *Do members have any feedback on our agreement? Shall we adopt any new content from the DS Collective agreement, or from elsewhere? Shall we remove anything? Add? Change anything?*
- üì¢ Comment and suggest changes in [DRAFT_uwl_pythonig_comm_agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hgx4cfDhR_BDKSzUB-vDKso422DV0zg2lvtnN66PW6E/edit?usp=sharing)
- üìú Community agreement is published [at uwlib-python-ig/meetings](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/meetings#community-agreement)

### Discussion
- (Benjamin | ries07) **Proposal**: Announce our agreement at the beginning of meetings (haven't been doing this)
- DEI/anti-racism/social justice in the DS Collective agreement
	- Including this in the DS Collective agreement came about in part because projects people were presenting were engaging with social justice, this seemed to be something members care about
	- It seems like there is a component of this, or could be a component, in Python/coding work; this is something to think about -- is there space to carry out or act on these values?
	- "I've experienced this group as kind and caring, *and* as a space for professional development"
	- An example of tech + EDI/AR: Melanie Walsh's approach to teaching Python
	- Perhaps if we included this language it might support members in making connections between Python projects and engagement with social justice--could we put it as aspirational?
- There seems to be a gender bias in tech, for example; certainly there are *other/more* challenges in the tech world, beyond racism
- For example, what about bridging the digital divide?
- What is the digital divide?
	- Not everyone has a laptop to learn coding on
	- Applications should be mobile-friendly
	- Code should be made available for reuse 
	- Translating applications into other languages 
- PLAN: Benjamin writes a 'straw man' paragraph to get the ball rolling
- Another idea from the Collective: group activity
	- Group exercise, brainstorming ideas; could use brainstorming rooms 
- Experience similar to another group: We spend time discussing 'why are we here?' So, why? Some suggestions:
	- Support each other
	- Play an educational role in the community -- example, look for folks doing repetitive tasks and provide support for automating processes 
	- What about a broader 'why are we here' component to the agreement? 
	
### ‚ö° ACTION ITEMS
- [ ] (Benjamin) Draft new content bringing in social justice language from DS Collective agreement
- [ ] (Benjamin) Share this for review prior to next meeting
- [ ] Continue discussion on agreement at at next meeting, including review of new draft content and generative brainstorming, one suggested topic is discussing the group's purpose(s)

## UWL PIG 2024
***What are members interested in learning about and doing with Python in 2024?***

### Discussion
*Add session ideas, 2024 Python goals, and feedback here!*  
- Thomas Johnson (tej5)
    - I hope to attend both the [PyCascades](https://2024.pycascades.com/) (in Seattle next year) and maybe the [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2024/) conference later in May. Maybe a conference retrospective would be fun to share in a session. Is anyone else considering attending these or other conferences in 2024?
        - Puget Sound Python user groups exist - for example [PuPPy: Puget Sound Programming Python](https://www.pspython.com/app/)
        - Thomas has been active in user groups and so was interested in our UWL group--making connections through Python
    - I've started to work on some Python tools to help me learn Chinese in 2024.
        - Working on a dictionary app using [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (in the standard library) to help find relations between characters 
        - Playing with Python [Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) library for speech-to-text transcription (see also [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYPDSl9FVDQ))
- Benjamin | ries07 : 2024 Python goals
    - Learn how to do more with the amazing [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/), which I use all the time, but really haven't scratched the surface of
    - Make some progress in LP3THW -- I left off around [exercise 45](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/lp3thw/tree/master/ex45); the exercises get significantly more challenging at this point with object-oriented programming skills, but I've made a little progress in this area and I want to keep going in the book!
- Eulalie:
    - I'm interested in Whisper! Could this be used for transcribing oral-histories? 
- Azusa:
    - I'm a member of the AI task force, so I'd like to continue attending here from that perspective; looking for tools/resources to learn about AI and become 'AI literate'
    - Also working on a machine-learning project which I presented at the DS Collective (see [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1m_5R-w2KYGUKtZCPkF4uNTSbRFCeGKvsUXIdKMXgZIU/edit#slide=id.p))
        - Looking at premodern Japanese paper, to see whether machine learning can help identify the date of production of paper
        - This has me using Python to process images
        - Also interested generally in automating tasks and making work easier 
- Jonathan:
    - Still doing AI work! [Discussed a project previously](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/meetings/blob/main/20231102_ai_open_discussion.md#open-discussion), currently working on remote access for librarians; goal is to search the last 20 years of law-library memos and provide responses based on that information
    - Another possible goal for next year is to create a public resource (no login) using generative AI to give a reasonable analysis of legal issues
        - What would the 'raw materials' (is 'training data' the correct term?) be?
            - You have to tell the AI what a statute is, what a case is, 'give it a civics lesson'
            - Scrape open-access sites (not material under copyright), index these in a vector database, make the database retrievable
            - ‚òù Include many disclaimers and caveats! *This should not be relied upon for legal advice*
            - This is already being done by a lot of companies, but this would be a free public service
            - One of the major legal vendors plans to release an AI tool to law students across the country on January 8th--this is significant for legal education! 
- Elliott:
    - I'd like to continue attending this group and learning!
    - I'm interested in [new programs in textual and digital studies](https://txtds.uw.edu/), and Python figures prominently
