# MEETING NOTES

## Agenda:

### Quick welcome for new attendees/information about the PIG

* [Community Agreement](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings/blob/main/README.md#community-agreement) can be viewed at our [meetings](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings) repository, which is where notes and shared resources from meetings can be found!
* If you are working through [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/l9c4fq/CP71290856150001451) and would like to share exercise-related code, or look at examples from others, see the [lp3thw](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/lp3thw) repository \(let [Ben Riesenberg](mailto:ries07@uw.edu) know if you'd like to be a contributor to the repo\)

### Quick note re: PIG meetings for 2021

* Requesting feedback on the current PIG meeting schedule: **Meet once every three weeks, Thursday at 11:00**
  * Please email [Ben](mailto:ries07@uw.edu) if you'd prefer a different meeting time
  * If it seems that readjusting meeting times would be good, we'll set up a poll, etc.
  * If not, we'll schedule for the first half of 2021 as above

## Presentation and discussion

[**Vishwa Pardeshi**](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi)**, UW Libraries Text Mining Student Specialist**

### Notes

* Vishwa is working with UW Libraries and the eScience Institute; also an AI fellow at Giving Tech labs, using NLP to build knowledge graphs; works almost exclusively in Python
* Some terms:
  * ML: Machine Learning
  * NLP: Natural Language Processing
* Background on NLP:
  * ML transitioned into NLP when someone realized that we could use numbers to represent words and apply ML techniques
  * The beginning of NLP was writing a lot of rules, things were very rule-based, this meant that programmers had to know a lot about the domain
  * ML changes this
  * We can think of columns in a data spreadsheet as features, ML can populate new features
  * So using ML+NLP, we can extract features from text to determine similarity: the computer will attempt to generate features--number of words, sentences; frequency of words \(using algorithms\); using these features a value can be placed on document similarity
  * NLP is progressing very quickly! 5-6 new groundbreaking state-of-the-art models a year!! For example a recent development is Google code which can hold conversations \(GBT3\) and even write code; GBT2 is openly available 
  * Some NLP applications: sentiment analysis, topic modelling \(extensively used in libraries\), similarity analysis, opinion mining
* Looking at some projects:
  * [NL\_Parser\_using\_Spacy](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi/NL_Parser_using_Spacy): 
    * Extracting ingredients from recipes--not easy to do!
  * [Text\_Classification\_UW\_Presidential\_Nominees\_2020](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi/Text_Classification_US_Presidential_Nominees_2020):
    * The first step in any NLP project is to prepare your data!
    * Loading and preparing the data uses pandas...
    * We need to filter out the words that _everyone_ uses
    * tfidf/Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency: Comparing words that appear in _all documents_ \(stop words\) versus words that only appear in _only some documents_ \(here's a [Programming Historian tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/analyzing-documents-with-tfidf)\)
    * A rule for ML: As you manipulate data, put any new values you create in new columns, don't replace parts of your raw data \(this may cause problems later\); you may need to use the raw data again later for other analyses
    * In NLP, "the more features \[you look at\] the better"

### Questions

* What are some use cases?
  * Document similarity: Find similar resources based on user interest, or generate keywords that can be used for search, based on a set of materials from a user
  * Subject classification?
  * Erin shared [AI4LAM](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam), related work with "artificial intelligence for libraries, archives, and museums"
* What is [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)?
  * Any data scientist uses panda! Python Data Analysis
  * It puts data in table form; this allows you to run common Python functions and do many other things including visualization \("plotting"\), re-formatting, ...
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) \(numerical Python\) is always very useful
  * Increases processing speed for numerical data
  * Also used extensively in ML and NLP
* Let's look at the list of imports for Python libraries used:
  * See [Text\_Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi/Text_Classification_US_Presidential_Nominees_2020/blob/a8f37a68e4136c933d690c372f625ab245f50ccf/Text_Classification.ipynb)
* [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) vs. [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
  * It depends on the features that you want to use
  * In the work we viewed there was a lot of text preprocessing, for which NLTK worked well
* What about resources for learning NLP?
  * There is a 300-level course but only CS majors can take it, there is also a 500-level course
  * Some resources on Coursera, Vishwa likes the approach that Data Camp takes
  * O'Reilly has several books on NLP, the presenter likes to make use of O'Reilly, these often include recommended level of experience
  * See **resources** below!
