***CHANGES APPROVED âœ… BMR WILL PUBLISH CHANGES AT uwlib-python-ig/meetings***

## Open discussion/2024 session ideas
- **(BMR) Anyone have a project they'd like to present on?**
    - (BMR) \@TJ I'd love to hear about building a CLI in Python!
    - (BMR) Another idea: Does anyone have experience contributing to an open-source codebase? What's that like??
    - (BMR) Another another idea: Any kind of tutorial!
- **(TJ) We talked about the PyCascades conference!** 
    - https://2024.pycascades.com/news/dates-and-venue-announced/
    - Happening in April, paid conference, scholarship options may be available
    - If any of us go, let's report out to the group on the conference!
- **(ES) Projects and processes: Hearing about 'the work', focusing on a project is helpful for me**
    - Perhaps there are even people interested in receiving feedback on a project?
    - Info about projects could save a beginner's time (oh, I'll do it the way they did it in their project)
- **(JF) Ways to make our tools available to others**
    - Are we expecting other people to understand GitHub? Or can we make a tool available in a more simple way? 
    - Simply, how to share things?? Faculty/staff servers? (We each have a space -- this *could* be used as an endpoint for an API...) Azure? How to work within the UW framework to make an API accessible
    - The linked data team has also thought about this! "How to get an endpoint at UW" (LDT example is wanting to set up a SPARQL endpoint)
    - Related issue: Departments replicating services that UW IT offers
    - Could we invite UW IT to provide info about this? 
    - What about a reading that discusses different models for endpoints? What is an endpoint??
        - "A communication where the preferred protocol is HTTP" might be one definition
    - Potentially useful documentation links for UW-IT compute offerings:
        - UW-IT shared web-hosting: https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/storage-hosting/shared-web-hosting/
        - HYAK research computing: https://hyak.uw.edu/docs
- **(MG) I'm also interested in this topic writ large -- how to share tools!**
- **(EM) I second what people have said -- I'd like to hear about projects!**
    - I'm using [ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) -- I don't think it's typical

## Action items
- (BMR, members) Nominate a Python reading for the group! BMR will start the email thread
- (BMR, EJ) BMR and EJ will reach out to Anna Preuss at the iSchool about presenting
