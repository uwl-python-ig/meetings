## Discussion
- Discuss new [resource list](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/shared-01/blob/main/python-resources-062524.md) -- anyone have something to add?
    - University of Illinois -- Prof Wickes has a list of [Python learning resources](https://elizabethwickes.com/pythonresources/). 
    - Melanie Walsh, [*Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python*](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)
- Discuss Constellate Python Basics workshop
- Learning new tools gives you agency. Example: moving through the world without public speaking practice makes it harder to advocate for yourself. 
- If you need to do something, starting to learn can make it harder. If make space in your career, makes it easier, pays off in career. 
- What are the places in the humanities where they do work with Python? Not necessarily where they're hitting a wall. 
- But things like sentiment analysis -- doesn't always make sense. Giving someone powerful tools, important socially and culturally, but want people to know *why* they're using those tools. SA as sorting tool, but still worried about what we lose when we do those things. 
- Local DH community -- ethics and responsibility of using them. Doesn't always make it into introductory lessons. 
- Tool is here. We can use it, but we need to talk about what it gives us -- ways in which it helps us vs ways in which it's a neat trick. Python workshops at UW more about that message. 
- Literal, speculative, synthetic. 
- A lot of value in helping people understand what these tools are, what they do, how they work, so that when they encounter them they are able to critically analyze what others are doing. 
- Discussion about LLMs, how they're used, how we're thinking about them and helping others think about them.
