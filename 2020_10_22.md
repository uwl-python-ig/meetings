Melissa Morgan, a graduate student assistant in the Cataloging and Metadata Services unit, presented on [rml.py](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings/blob/main/shared_code/rml.py):

* Uses Pythonâ€™s [OS library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html) to execute a Java .jar file for data conversion
* Uses the [rdflib package](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to encode converted RDF data in a specified format and manage namespaces
* \(does many more things...\)

The code is part of [a larger, ongoing project](https://github.com/uwlib-cams/rml) to convert bibliographic data between data models using the [RDF Mapping Language \(RML\)](https://rml.io/specs/rml/) and [RMLMapper](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java).
