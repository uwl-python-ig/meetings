# 2020-12-03 University of Washington Libraries Python Interest Group meeting

## Agenda:

### 1. Will the PIG create or adopt a community agreement or other document to provide best practices for our meetings? Some options:

* Adopt [a modified version](https://hackmd.io/@ries07/Byc87tecD) of the UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Collective's community agreement
* Create our own community agreement, based on the DS Collective's work, or based on something else, or something completely original and unlike any community agreement ever known
* Do nothing
* Do something else?

#### Discussion

* 100% of attendees agreed to adopt our slightly-modified version of the DS Collective's community agreement for the time being
* This will be included in the [meetings repository README](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings/blob/main/README.md)

### 2. What are members interested in hearing about during the upcoming presentation from Vishwa Pardeshi, UW Libraries Text Mining Student Specialist?

* Vishwa kindly shared a link to [some past projects](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi) so we could take a look and indicate what we are interested in hearing about
* Alternately, of course, we could just ask to hear about the work overall, and see where the discussion goes from there! 
* And don't forget to fill out the [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/ng7pff7kdi5xmytf?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link) so we can set an alternate time and day for the meeting \(it would otherwise fall on Dec. 24\)

#### Discussion

* Ben and Melissa looked at Vishwa's projects and we are interested in hearing about the [Text\_Classification\_US\_Presidential\_Nominees\_2020](https://github.com/vishwapardeshi/Text_Classification_US_Presidential_Nominees_2020) project
