# 2024-08-01 University of Washington Libraries Python Interest Group meeting
## Greeting / review Python IG community Agreement 🤝
> - **Our [community agreement](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/meetings/tree/main#community-agreement) is adapted from that of the UW Libraries Digital Scholarship Collective**  
> - *[More UWL Python Interest Group information](https://github.com/uwlib-python-ig/meetings#get-in-touch-with-the-pig)* 

## Announcements
> - Introductions if time and number of participants permits, else please say hello in chat!

## Discussion
- Potential discussion: what do you want to get out of this group?
     - Practical presentations. What people are doing with Python.
     - Identify anyone on campus -- maybe with new BTAA, or other alliances, to identify anyone doing things with Python. Google Doc with people who seem cool and might be open to just visiting.
     - At the beginning of the group, moment where Hana and Benjamin were working through Learn Python the Hard Way. Or instead of a text, a beginner project. Find something and deconstruct it.
     - In CAMS, study group based on certain technologies that they've wanted to learn. Since there are a lot of people who are at a point of wanting to build up skills, doing something like a text or a class we all want to sign up for.
     - Seconded -- a class or a book. Need to learn how to do it. Think it would be helpful that even if we just had a study group on the side and talked about study groups periodically.
     - Liked when people shared their projects. Ex. Anna's project, John's projects -- doing some of that myself, can help make my life easier.
     - Melanie Walsh's book -- she's here, seems like a great book. More digital humanities focused. Real life examples, sample datasets. Could maybe even audit her class in the future.
     - Next steps: NA will customize the course schedule. NA will create doc to gather names of potential speakers.
     - John's presentation -- validation tools. Also, if we could find someone who is using Python with APIs. Lots of library systems rely on APIs to do more complex data pulling. NA can share her experience using them in R. Especially important in terms of linked data, data sources, etc. Hugely important.
     - Want to learn pandas
     - Interested in doing exercises. Take on Python in the digital humanities -- some things are just a trick, like sentiment analysis, doesn't seem useful. But then think of Anna's presentation, lots of scanned info, but useless as is. Needed to use Python. Interested in things that are in an archive in print and using Python to make them useful and able to be analyzed. Such as Special Collections content -- could be a good grad student project. Creating dataset on scans and using Python to clean it up.
     - Andrew uses Ruby to automate some tasks in data collection. Things like file naming. Would be great to automate, batch process that can do something for 100 things rather than me doing it 100 times.
     - Some of these things can connect to wider Libraries collections. Ex. Benjamin -- bespoke products, once people leave employment and there's not enough documentation. Realm of one. Are there tools that we can share that can be useful to others. Maybe someone out there who has made what I want.
     - Sustainability of projects -- maybe things to think about in the Python IG. Maybe we can talk about LLMs, AI. Maybe useful, maybe not. Coming back to ideas of labor/labor creep.
